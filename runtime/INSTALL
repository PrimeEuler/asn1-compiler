= Prerequisites =
  * C/C++ compiler (GNU GCC 4.4.2 or newer, MS VS 2010)
  * Boost library (www.boost.org), only for unit tests
  * CMake (www.cmake.org)

= How to build from source =
  Create directory:
    runtime# mkdir build

  Go inside directory:
    runtime# cd build

  Launch CMake:
    build# cmake ..

After the last command execution, the project files will be generated by CMake build system.
Depending on what was generated build runtime library and tests.

  I.e. for GNU/Linux execute GNU make:
    build# make
